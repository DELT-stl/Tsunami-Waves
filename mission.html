As you already may know, I was that kid with no glove and no spikes, but I had dreams of one day playing in the big leagues. Now that I'm capable of giving back, I'm totally involved in this cause. With my foundation, Tsunami Waves, I donate equipment on a yearly basis to underprivileged kids in my home town Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic."
